Rust lib to convert numbers into English words.

The [short scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_and_short_scale_words#Comparison),
has different words for each power of 1000.

This library expresses numbers from zero to thousands,
millions, billions, trillions, and quadrillions, up to 999_999_999_999_999_999.

### Function
```rust
pub fn shortscale(num: u64) -> String
```

### Example
```rust
use shortscale::shortscale;

assert_eq!(
    shortscale(420_000_999_015),
    "four hundred and twenty billion nine hundred \
    and ninety nine thousand and fifteen"
);
```
